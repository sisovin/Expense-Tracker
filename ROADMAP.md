# Roadmap on the Expense Tracker Project

This project is a demo project for creating an expense tracker using SaaS (Software as a Service) with jQuery. It involves several steps, covering setting up the front-end with jQuery, a simple back-end API to handle data, and integrating with a SaaS database for storage. This online software platform will perform the step-by-step guide:

## Step 1: Setting Up the Project

1.1 Create a New Project Directory
- Create a new directory for your project.

1.2 Initialize a New HTML File
- Create an index.html file with the basic structure of the expense tracker.

1.3 Create a jQuery Script File
- Create an app.js file to handle the front-end logic using jQuery.

## Step 2: Backend API

2.1 Initialize Node.js Project
- Run `npm init -y` to create a `package.json` file.
- Install necessary dependencies: express, body-parser, and fs.

2.2 Create the Backend Server
- Create a server.js file to handle API requests using Express.

2.3 Run the Server
- Run `node server.js` to start the server.

## Step 3: Frontend Implementation

3.1 Design the HTML Structure
- Design the form and table structure in index.html to add and display expenses.

3.2 Implement jQuery Logic
- Implement the logic in app.js to handle form submissions, fetch expenses, and update the table dynamically.

## Step 4: API Endpoints

4.1 Create GET Endpoint
- Create a GET endpoint in server.js to fetch all expenses.

4.2 Create POST Endpoint
- Create a POST endpoint in server.js to add a new expense.

4.3 Create PUT Endpoint
- Create a PUT endpoint in server.js to update an existing expense.

4.4 Create DELETE Endpoint
- Create a DELETE endpoint in server.js to delete an expense.

## Step 5: Data Storage

5.1 Create a Data File
- Create a data.json file to store the expenses.
- or Connection to SaaS with API_BASE = "https://your-saas-api.com"; // Replace with your SaaS API endpoint

5.2 Read and Write Data
- Implement logic in server.js to read from and write to data.json.

## Step 6: Testing

6.1 Test API Endpoints
- Use Postman to test the API endpoints and ensure they are working correctly.

6.2 Test Frontend
- Test the frontend by adding, updating, and deleting expenses to ensure everything is working as expected.

## Summary

- **Frontend**: HTML and jQuery to interact with the user.
- **Backend**: Node.js and Express to handle API requests.
- **Data Storage**: JSON file (data.json) to store expenses.

This setup provides a basic expense tracker application using jQuery and a simple backend API. You can customize it further to meet the needs for personal financial management.

## Additional Tools

- **npx json-server**: For quick prototyping, you can use 

npx json-server@latest -p 3500 -w backend/db/data.json to create a mock server.

This roadmap should guide you through the process of creating a fully functional expense tracker application.
